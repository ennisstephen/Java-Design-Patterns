# Java Design Patterns Examples

This repository contains examples of great design patterns in Java. The code examples are inspired by the book "Head First Design Patterns" by Eric Freeman and Elisabeth Robson et al (Second Edition). The book itself was inspired by the famous "Gang of Four" Design Patterns book.

The goal of this repository is to provide clear and concise examples of design patterns that can be easily understood and adapted to different projects. Each design pattern is implemented using Java, and comes with an explanation of the problem it solves, how it works, and when it should be used.
